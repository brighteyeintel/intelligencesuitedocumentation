# Getting your API key

API Keys are currently only given following an accepted application. To apply for an API key, email <a href="mailto:hello@brighteyeintel.co.uk">hello@brighteyeintel.co.uk</a> with the following details:

- The email your account is registered to
- What your intended use case for the API key is
- Your anticipated volume of requests

API keys are currently distributed on this basis as BEI is still in a developmental phase, and we wish to limit API access. If your application is successful, you will be contacted with your API key, and it will also become visible in your profile page on <a href="brighteyeintel.co.uk">Bright Eye Intel</a>.
